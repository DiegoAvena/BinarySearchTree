A BST data structure that orders nodes based on their keys in such a way that nodes with keys less than the root go to the left, and nodes with keys greater than the root go to the right, and so on and so forth. This BST does not contain any mechanism to keep itself balanced.

When this program is ran, all it does is test the various features of this data structure with random, hardcoded, data.

## How to run: 

1.) To run with make, type: make run

2.) To compile with make, type: make all
